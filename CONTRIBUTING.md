# Contributors are welcome :)

## Bug or question

Please use issues for bug reports and questions.

When reporting a bug please provide either:

- a repository with a bug
- create an issue with bug description and PR with a test that contains the failing scenario

## New features

Please file an issue before actually implementing a new feature.

If the feature is approved - PRs are welcome :)

## New integration

Currently only `plain` projects, `Vue` applications based on `Vite` and `Nuxt` projects are supported and tested.

_In theory_, projects with various frameworks based on Vite are supported, but not tested.

If you would like to create a new integration for your favorite framework - do as described in the [New Feature](#new-features) section, after feature approved you will be granted with `collaborator` role.
